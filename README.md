**Textually Yours** is a chat app designed for meaningful conversations between two people. It’s simple, direct, and focuses on the beauty of a one-on-one connection without distractions.

## What is Textually Yours?

**Textually Yours** is not your average chat app. It’s a space for those who value deeper connections and intimacy. If you're tired of group chats, endless notifications, and the noise of too many people, this app is for you. It’s about having one special connection that’s just between you and your one chosen person. Here's what makes **Textually Yours** special:

### Features:
- **No Un-sending Messages**: Once you send a message, it’s out there for good. Choose your words carefully. This feature ensures that you think before you speak, making every conversation more meaningful.
- **Watch the Conversation Unfold**: See exactly what the other person is typing in real-time, even before they hit send. It's a way to truly connect and engage in the conversation as it happens, enhancing the experience of communication.
- **Complete Privacy**: All your messages are stored locally on your device — no clouds, no servers. This ensures your messages stay private and secure, just between you and your special someone. It's all about trust.
- **The One and Only**: You can only connect with **one** person. Think carefully about your choice, because once you're connected, it’s permanent. If you ever delete the app, don’t worry — the connection stays intact, like an emotional boomerang that always comes back.
- **Know If They Miss You**: Sometimes, it’s the little things that count. 
  If you’re waiting for your special someone to respond, Textually Yours will notify them that you’re waiting! Who knows, they might just be missing you too!
- **Make It Your Own**: Feel free to customize the application in the way you
  want!
